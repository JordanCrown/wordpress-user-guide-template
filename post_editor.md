# Post Editor

Creating a new post, or selecting an existing one, will open up the post editor page within the WordPress admin. To create a new post, you can either click the Add New submenu item under the desired post type section in the main admin navigation, click the Add New button to the right of the title above the all posts table, or select the type of post you want to add from the +New dropdown in the user toolbar.
