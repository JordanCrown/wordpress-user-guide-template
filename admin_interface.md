# Admin Interface

### User Toolbar

Whenever logged in, you will see a toolbar across the top of the admin as well as front end pages of your site. This contains many commonly-used links and controls for managing your site.

On the left side of the toolbar is the title of your site. When in the site admin, this will link to your site's homepage. When viewing the front end of the site, clicking this will return you to the admin dashboard or one of the admin pages listed in the submenu dropdown that appears on hover.

To the right on the toolbar you'll find the name of the person who's currently logged in. Hovering over this item will reveal a link to edit your profile as well as a link to log out.

Other links may appear in the user toolbar depending on the context of the current page you're viewing, including the following:

* Pending site updates
* Comments awaiting moderation
* Quick links to create different types of content
* Controls for various installed plugins

From within the WordPress admin, directly below the toolbar, on the right hand side, there may be a couple of small inverted tabs, *Screen Options* and *Help*. Clicking either of these links will cause a panel to slide down from the top of the page. The *Help* tab displays some help information associated with the current page. The *Screen Options* link will display various options that allow you to configure what is displayed on the page. The presence of these tabs, as well as the contents and controls within their panels, change depending on what page you're currently on.

### Admin Menu

Down the left-hand side of the WordPress admin you will see your main admin navigation menu. This is where you'll find all the options to update and configure your site. 

Hovering your cursor over each of the main menu items will display a fly-out submenu with the various choices for that particular menu item. Once you click each of the main menu items, that particular menu will expand to show all the available subpages within that section (if there are any).

Here's a brief overview of the admin menu items and their usage:

#### Dashboard
