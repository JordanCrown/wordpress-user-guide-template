# Shortcodes

A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line.

Shortcodes can be self-contained or they be used to wrap content to alter its appearance (as defined with an opening and closing shortcode set). Additionally, shortcodes can accept any number of attributes depending on its type to control the shortcodeâ€™s functionality.
