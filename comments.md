# Comments

Comments are user-submitted entries associated with a single post on your site. These can be managed under the *Comments* item in the admin menu.

The comments admin page lists out the responses that have been made to all the posts on your site. A comment can be in a state of approved, pending, spam, or trash. The only types of comments that will show up on the front end of your site are ones that have already been approved. The status of comments can be easily switch be clicking on the appropriate link the in the comment options that appear when hovering over the particular entry.

Another action that can be taken in the comments admin section is replying to an individual comment. Clicking the *Reply* link in the comment options that display on hover will open up a form that will allow you to write a message in response to said comment. Your reply will be posted on the related post's page on your site and the commenter will be notified.
