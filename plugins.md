# Plugins

Plugins are used to extend the functionality of WordPress' core. While we try to keep the number of installed plugins to a minimum, there are several we've activated that provide many enhancements to your website.

## Akismet

The *Akismet* plugin, made by the same people responsible for WordPress, performs automatic comment spam filtering. Settings for this plugin can be configured under the *Akismet* submenu item within the *Settings* section of the WordPress admin. Visit the [plugin's website](https://akismet.com) for more information.

## Google Analytics by Yoast

The *Google Analytics* plugin is used for adding your Google Analytics tracking script to your website. This plugin's configuration can be managed under the *Analytics* menu item in the WordPress admin's main menu. More information can be found on the [plugin's website](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/google-analytics/).

## Gravity Forms

The *Gravity Forms* plugin adds the *Forms* menu item to the main navigation within the WordPress admin. This module adds the contact form functionality used throughout your website. For more information, you can visit the [plugin's website](http://www.gravityforms.com).

## Site Framework

The *Site Framework* plugin was written specifically for your site by Jordan Crown. It adds all the custom functionality required for your particular setup, including {post types}, {taxonomies}, and {settings pages}.

## Yoast SEO

The *Yoast SEO* plugin adds enhancements to your site to allow for easier indexing by search engines. The plugin's general settings can be configured under the *SEO* menu item in the WordPress admin's main menu while settings for individual posts can be managed within their respective post editor page in the *Yoast SEO* panel.
