# [btn]

The *btn* shortcode can be used to generate button-styled links. These should be treated very similarly to HTML anchor tags and share many of the same attributes.

```
[btn href="http://example.com" target="_blank"]Learn More[/btn]
```

*btn* shortcodes can accept a few different attributes to control how the link looks and behaves:

* **`href`:** Used for defining the URL in which you'd like to link to.
* **`target`:** Sets the target attribute of the generated anchor HTML element to define where to display the linked resource.
* **`post_id`:** Can be set to the ID of a post to dynamically set the *href* attribute to the URL of that post.
* **`class`:** Any extra CSS classes you wish to add to modify the appearance of the button.
