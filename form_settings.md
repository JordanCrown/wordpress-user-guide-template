# Form Settings

By clicking the *Form Settings* option in the form navigation, you'll be able to access general configuration settings for the particular form. Information such as the form's title, description, submit button label can be updated here. Most of these settings are fine the way they are by default so it won't always be necessary to make any changes to this page.
