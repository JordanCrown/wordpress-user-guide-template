# WordPress Concepts

The content that appears on your site can be stored and organized in multiple ways based on the intent. Content is broken up into multiple entries of different types (post types). These can be strategically grouped using various taxonomies. Additionally, related main articles can be supplemented with related content via widgets. Finally, website pages are all linked together using various forms of navigation.

### Post Types

In WordPress, all primary content is stored as what are called posts. Generally speaking, posts are associated with at least a title and some main content. Typically, all post types will have a one to one relationship between the post entry and a dedicated page on your site. Different types of posts, with unique sets of fields, can be used for different purposes within the site to allow for greater flexibility and scalability.

WordPressâ€™ core post types include:

* **Posts:** Articles that appear in the blog
* **Pages:** Free-form website pages
* **Media:** Images, videos, documents, etc.

Additionally, your site has been customized to include the following types of posts:
