# Posts

Posts are content entries that show up in the blog of your site. These can be managed under the *Posts* item in the admin menu.

The basics of a post entry consist of a post title and content. Other types of information can be associated with a post such as an excerpt, author, publish date, etc. Additionally, posts may be organized into categories or tagged with certain key words to group similar posts together.
