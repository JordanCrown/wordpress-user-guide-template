# Pages

Pages, as their name implies, are used for static content that wonâ€™t be updating very often on your site. These can be managed under the *Pages* item in the admin menu.

Pages, as defined within WordPress, behave similar to blog posts. At its core, a page has a title, some main content, and has its own URL on the front end of the website. Also like posts, pages may have extra meta data associated with them to customize the content, layout, and/or functionality. In contrast, while posts are generally organized chronologically, pages can be organized in whatever way makes the most sense. Additionally, pages can be sorted hierarchically to organize thoughts into varying levels of importance.

You can create new pages by clicking the *Add New* link within the *Pages* submenu of the admin navigation or selecting *Page* from the *+New* menu item in the user toolbar.
