# Dashboard

Once you've logged in, the WordPress dashboard appears. This is your main administration homepage.

The dashboard serves as the landing page for the WordPress admin. You'll find various widgets for monitoring the status and activity of your site as well as news feeds or controls for installed plugins. There's also a *Quick Draft* widget that allows you to quickly capture some ideas you may have that you want to turn into blog posts later on.
