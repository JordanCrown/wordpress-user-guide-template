# WordPress Concepts

The content that appears on your site can be stored and organized in multiple ways based on the intent. Content is broken up into multiple entries of different types (post types). These can be strategically grouped using various taxonomies. Additionally, related main articles can be supplemented with related content via widgets. Finally, website pages are all linked together using various forms of navigation.

### Post Types

In WordPress, all primary content is stored as what are called posts. Generally speaking, posts are associated with at least a title and some main content. Typically, all post types will have a one to one relationship between the post entry and a dedicated page on your site. Different types of posts, with unique sets of fields, can be used for different purposes within the site to allow for greater flexibility and scalability.

WordPress’ core post types include:

* **Posts:** Articles that appear in the blog
* **Pages:** Free-form website pages
* **Media:** Images, videos, documents, etc.

Additionally, your site has been customized to include the following types of posts:

* **{Post Type}:** {Description}
* **{Post Type}:** {Description}
* **{Post Type}:** {Description}

### Comments

Comments are content entries tied directly to a specific post. Visitors can leave comments in response to various pieces of content on your site. Commenting functionality is most commonly used with blog posts and news articles to allow for discussion on recent or trending topics.

### Taxonomies

Content of a similar post type can be related by associating it with various taxonomy terms. For example, blog posts can placed into different categories to group similar topics. Additionally, blog posts can potentially be related by tags to link together posts that use similar keywords.

Terms within a taxonomy can function in one of two ways:

* **Hierarchical:** Related via parent-child associations (e.g. categories)
* **Ad-Hoc:** No relationship between terms (e.g. tags)

Taxonomies on your site have been set up to be relevant to types of posts with which they are associated.

### Widgets

Content that you want to behave independently of a page's main content can be stored in various types of widgets. This may include links to recent blog posts, a site search form, or some free-form content.

Your theme has been configured with a set of areas where these widgets can be placed. These widget areas are utilized by different templates on your site based on the context of the page’s main content.

### Navigation

All the different pieces of content on your site are linked together through a set of navigation menu elements. These menus are a collection of links to pages, posts, categories, custom links, or other types of content. Menu items may be organized hierarchically to establish a level of importance between content.

Menus can be attributed to a specific menu location within your theme. For example, a custom menu can be built and be marked to be used as the navigation in the site's header.

### Settings

For everything else, your WordPress site can be configured through various sets of options. Settings fields, such as for your site's title or the page defined as your homepage, are stored independently from the rest of the site's content.
