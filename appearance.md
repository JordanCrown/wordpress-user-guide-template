# Appearance

Menu items under the *Appearance* section of the main admin navigation control various aspects of how your site's content is presented.

## Themes

The *Themes* subpage in the *Appearance* section allows you to select which theme is to be used by your site. **The custom theme we built for you has already been selected and should not be switched.**

## Customize

The *Customize* submenu item will take you to the WordPress customizer. This user interface allows you to make changes to various site settings as well as configure navigational elements and sidebar contents. The available options to edit will change depending on which page you're previewing. Changes are made in real time to the site preview so you can see how they'll affect the site's appearance.

When you're satisfied with your changes, be sure to hit the Save & Publish button at the top of the left sidebar.

## Widgets

Widgets are small pieces of content that can be placed in various locations on the site, typically independent from the main content of the page on which they exist. The available widget areas, and the widgets they contain, can be managed under the *Widgets* subpage under the *Appearance* section of the admin main menu.

### Adding Widgets

On the *Widgets* manager page, on the left side, you'll see all the available widgets you can add to your site. Adding these to one of the designated widget areas can be done by selecting the desired widget and choosing which area you want to add it to, or by simply dragging the widget into said widget area on the right of the page.

Below the available widgets, there's a separate section, titled *Inactive Widgets*. This can be used for archiving unused widgets without losing their settings. Widgets can be restored from this section by placing them back in the desired widget area.

### Configuring Widgets

Once a widget has been placed in a widget area, you can edit its settings by expanding its field set by clicking on the widget's title bar. The available fields will vary depending on what type of widget it is. Once you're happy with your changes, hit the *Save* button for that widget.

## Menus

The *Menus* subpage under the *Appearance* section of the WordPress admin is used for managing assorted sets of links used in various places by your site's theme.

Begin by selecting a menu to edit from the drop down at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can choose to create an entirely new menu by clicking the *create a new menu* link. Once you have your menu selected/created, you can add links to it from the various sections on the right side of the page. Some of the common menu items to add are links to pages but you may also need to link to other types of post types, taxonomy terms, or even add custom-defined links. If you're not seeing link options of a particular type, their group may just be toggled off in the *Screen Options* panel at the top of this page.

Once you've added links to your menu, these items can be dragged around to be reordered or sorted hierarchically. Clicking on an individual menu item will expand that item's configuration settings. Within here, you can tweak the menu link's behavior or appearance, such as overriding the label used within the menu on your site.

Below your menu's list of links, there are a some additional settings that can be configured for the menu you're currently editing. Most commonly, these options are used to configure where this menu will be used in your theme. For example, your site may have the option to define a menu as the one used in the header navigation.
