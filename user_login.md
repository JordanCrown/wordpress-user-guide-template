# User Login

Before you can make any changes to your site, you will need to log in. The WordPress admin can be accessed via the following URL:

http://{sitename.com}/wp-admin/

This should bring you to the login page (assuming you havenâ€™t already been authenticated).

Once you have entered your username and password, you will be taken to the WordPress admin dashboard.
