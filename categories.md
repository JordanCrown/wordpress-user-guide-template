# Categories

A category is a type of taxonomy associated with blog posts that can be used to group together articles on similar topics. Categories can be related to one another through parent-child relationships to establish a hierarchy of terms. On the front end of your website, there will be an index page for each category that lists all the included posts.

Categories can be created/updated using the category manager in the WordPress admin on the *Categories* subpage within the *Posts* section. Alternatively, categories can be created and/or assigned from within the post editor page in the *Categories* panel in the right column.
