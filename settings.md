## Writing

The *Writing* settings configure various options related to your site content. Settings include defining the default post category, default post format, and post via email options.

## Reading

You can define whether your front page displays a static page or your blog posts, how many blog posts are displayed by default as well as syndication/RSS options. If your site has been configured to display a static front page, you can set which page to display and also which page will show your blog posts. The search engine visibility setting enables you to block your site from search engines or allow it to be visible.

## Discussion

The *Discussion* settings define how your readers interact with your site and how your site interacts with other blogs. You can configure pingbacks and trackbacks, whether readers can post comments or not and if so, how those comments are moderated and displayed on your site.

This screen also lets you configure whether the post author should be emailed whenever someone posts a comment on your site. If you are receiving emails whenever someone posts a comment, simply uncheck the box next to *Anyone posts a commen*t within the *E-mail me whenever* section on this screen and then save your changes.

If you would like to be notified whenever a comment is held for moderation, it can be configured on this screen as well within the *E-mail me whenever* section. The email notification is sent to the email address listed on the *General* settings page.

## Media

The *Media* settings define the default image sizes that are created when an image is uploaded. You can also configure whether your uploaded media files are stored in folders based on the year and the month of the upload.

## Permalinks

The *Permalink* settings enable you to configure the URL format that is displayed in the web browser when someone visits your site. This also helps considerably with search engine optimization. To change the way your site URL is displayed simply select one of the radio button options within the *Common Settings* section on this screen. Next to each option is an example of how the URL would be displayed.
