# Adding a New User

To manually add a new user to your site, click on the Add New submenu item in the Users section of the main admin navigation or to the right of the title of the main users page. This will take you to a form for creating a new account.



At minimum, you must provide a username and email address for the new user, both of which must be unique to that user amongst the ones already registered. A password will automatically created for the user and sent to their email address upon creation. Be sure to set the appropriate role for the user to allow adequate permissions.
