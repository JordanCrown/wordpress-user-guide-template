# Tags

Much like the category taxonomy, tags can be applied to posts to link similar ones together through common keywords. The major difference between categories and tags is that tags cannot be related to one another and should be treated completely independently from one another (i.e. no hierarchical organization).

Tags have their own term manager in the *Tags* subpage under *Posts* in the WordPress admin. You can also quickly add tags by typing in the desired keywords in the *Tags* panel in the post editor page.
