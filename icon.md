# [icon]

The icon shortcode will embed the icon of your choice within your content.

```
[icon fa="star"]
```

Icons can be from *Font Awesome's* library. The type of icon is configured using the icon shortcode's attributes:

* **fa:** The name of the *Font Awesome* icon you wish to use. Available icons can be found [here](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).
* **class:** Any extra CSS classes you wish to add to modify the appearance of the icon.
