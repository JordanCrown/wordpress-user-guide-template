# Managing Content Types

As mentioned in the WordPress Concepts section, WordPress stores the majority of its content within entries called posts. Each post can contain different kinds of information, and be used for unique purposes, but their data models are mostly identical. Because of this, the WordPress admin user interface follows a similar pattern for content entry and management amongst the different types of posts.

There are three primary interfaces you'll encounter when managing posts of any type:

* All posts table
* Post editor
* Taxonomy term manager
